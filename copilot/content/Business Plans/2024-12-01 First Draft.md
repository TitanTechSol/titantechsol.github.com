# Generative AI and your business

# Working Backwards

- FAQ's: What are the questions the customer would ask about this product? What are the questions are peers going to ask about this product?
- Visuals: What would this product look like for our customers

# PR FAQ
- MLP, Minimum Loveable Product (feel good for Minimum Viable Product MVP)
- There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here's the big one: Customers are always beautifully, and wonderfully dissatisfied  -Jeff Bezos

# Who is your customer
- CTO: Development Directors: who have developers who are tech fluent but have shortfalls in specific tech
- they want solutions to their questions quickly and acurately
- concerned with security of their confedential data and intellectual property
- communication centric
- testing and quality focused

# What is the customer's problem/opportunity

## Leadership level
- Today: companies in need of development
- Have to: try and source development resources for creating their products
- When: trying to allocate resources they are short
- Customers need a way to: supplement their staff incrementally for specific problems
## Developer level
- Today: developers find themselves without specific domain knowledge
- Have to: train themselves on the fly
- When: trying to solve development issues for their company
- Customers need a way to: gain on the fly mentorship without breaching confedentiality, PHI, PI, IP, NDA, etc.

# Generate Ideas
- Worst way: Hire FTE resources for each possible permutation of technological innovation
- Best way: Engage reliable specialists on an as need basis without a breach of confidential data or intellectual property
- Big Tech: Train an AI for each of the possible spaces with "secure conversational threads" which would be disposed of upon completion of project and is secured on inception to be used by customer and human specialist
 - kind of like that Ben Afleck movie "Paycheck" where his memory is wiped after finishing the task
- Same as Big Tech... but no human specialists on demand
- Have you seen this problem in other industries? This problem exists in all industries.
- How would I make this bigger for my customer?
 - I would have to have the resources of the Big Tech and have confidentiality settings which are reliable for this process
- How would a child approach this?
 - I would just ask Dad. This is a direct quote from my 9yr old when I asked him
 - They would ask those they trust what they should do
- What is the craziest way to solve this problem
 - Make the information/question public and resolve through generative AI and crowd sourcing with remuneration going to the person with the best solution
 
# What is the solution and the most important customer benefit?
- I like a combination of the "Best Way" which was my original idea and the "Big Tech"
 - I like having an AI which is specifically trained for resolving particular problems which a human can use/train to better handle questions going forward.
  - Specialists which assist in the training of the AI will gain remuneration based on the content and the rating of the content they provide (passive income)
 - We could also use aspects of the "Craziest Way" for issues which are not confidential or IP which can leverage the specialist trained AI's to resolve questions quickly.
- I could bring a smile to my customer's face by giving them one extra employee (the vendor company) which they could use for any of their questions/mentorships etc

# Customer testimonial
"You know how AI pair programming seems to just not do what you want? Have you heard of GreyMatters? They are awesome!
It is like having the senior level architect developer without any of the know-it-all baggage AND all the umpf of a developer fresh out of college.
Yeah, it is AI but there are human specialists too.
You contract with one company and you get expertise, secure data, secure IP, and confidentiality.
The devs use them to solve sticky points, get mentoring, and research.
So glad I contracted with them."
