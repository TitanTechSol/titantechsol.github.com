# Lead Magnet Implementation

## Story Identifier: CO-00001.04-Lead-Magnet-Implementation

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** access valuable resources related to software development best practices,  
**So that** I can gain immediate value while considering TitanTech Solutions for my projects.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Lead magnets provide a lower-friction conversion point for visitors who aren't ready for direct contact, expanding the top of the sales funnel. This is medium priority as it supports but doesn't replace primary conversion paths.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Develop at least 3 high-value lead magnets (e.g., guides, templates, checklists)
- Create visually appealing lead magnet preview images
- Implement email collection forms with clear value proposition for each lead magnet
- Design post-download nurture sequences that guide users toward consultation requests
- Create dedicated landing pages for lead magnets with optimized conversion elements
- Implement strategic placement of lead magnet offers in content and sidebar areas
- Add exit-intent popups offering relevant lead magnets based on content being viewed
- Set up tracking to measure lead magnet performance and conversion to consultation
- Ensure mobile-friendly delivery of lead magnet content
