# Web Font Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00005-Font-Optimization

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** see website text render quickly without delays or flashing,  
**So that** I can start reading content immediately without visual disruption.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Font loading can significantly impact perceived performance and cause layout shifts. This is medium priority because improvements affect visual stability and perceived performance.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Audit and optimize all web fonts used on the site
- Implement font-display strategies to prevent invisible text during loading
- Reduce web font file sizes by subsetting fonts to include only needed characters
- Use appropriate font formats (WOFF2 with fallbacks)
- Implement self-hosting for any third-party fonts to eliminate external requests
- Eliminate render-blocking font resources
- Prevent layout shifts caused by font loading
- Document font usage and loading strategy
- Ensure consistent appearance across browsers and devices
- Improve First Contentful Paint and Cumulative Layout Shift metrics

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy

## Notes:
- Currently, the site uses Arial (system font), which is good for performance
- Consider expanding the font stack to use other system fonts for better aesthetics
- If custom fonts are used in the future, ensure they follow these optimization guidelines
- Test font rendering across different browsers and operating systems
- Consider variable fonts if a wide range of weights or styles are needed
