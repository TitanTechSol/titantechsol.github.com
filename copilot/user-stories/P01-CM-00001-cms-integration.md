# CMS Integration and Strategy

## Story Identifier: CM-00001-CMS-Integration-Strategy

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** implement an appropriate content management system for our website,  
**So that** non-technical team members can update website content without developer assistance.

## Priority: High (P01)
Content management is essential for keeping the website updated with current services, team information, and portfolio projects. Without a CMS, every update requires developer time, creating bottlenecks and limiting our ability to keep content fresh.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete a requirements analysis to determine specific content management needs
- Research and evaluate CMS options compatible with our React/GitHub Pages architecture
- Select an appropriate headless CMS solution based on ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost
- Document the content structure and information architecture for CMS implementation
- Create a proof of concept for at least one content type (e.g., team profiles or portfolio items)
- Define governance and workflows for content creation, review, and publishing
- Establish user roles and permission levels for different content contributors

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Consider headless CMS options like Contentful, Sanity.io, or Strapi that work well with React
- Must be compatible with GitHub Pages hosting
- Focus on solutions that don't require server-side processing
- Need to maintain the existing look and feel while enabling content editability
- Consider both immediate implementation needs and future scalability
