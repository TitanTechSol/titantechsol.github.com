# User Research and Feedback Implementation Plan

## Story Identifier: NP-00001.01-User-Research-Plan

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** establish an ongoing user research and feedback collection framework,  
**So that** we can continuously improve the website based on actual user needs rather than assumptions.

## Priority: High (P01)
This is high priority because understanding real user behavior and needs is foundational to making effective website improvements that actually serve our target audience.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define key user segments for research (technical decision-makers, business stakeholders, etc.)
- Establish 3-5 key research questions we need to answer about user behavior
- Create a feedback collection plan with multiple methodologies (surveys, interviews, analytics)
- Implement website feedback mechanisms (feedback forms, exit surveys, etc.)
- Develop a process for analyzing and acting upon collected feedback
- Create a schedule for regular user testing sessions with defined objectives
- Establish a repository for documenting and tracking user research findings
- Define a reporting format that connects insights to potential website improvements

## Dependencies:
- P01-NP-00001-strategic-roadmap (parent story)

## Notes:
- Focus research on understanding how different user types (technical vs. business stakeholders) navigate the site
- Include specific questions about how effectively the site communicates the junior-senior pairing value proposition
- Consider implementing session recording tools (with appropriate privacy measures) to observe actual user behavior
- Research should include competitive analysis of how similar services present their offerings
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance in all feedback collection methods
