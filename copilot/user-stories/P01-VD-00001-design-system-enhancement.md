# Design System Enhancement

## Story Identifier: VD-00001-Design-System-Enhancement

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** implement a comprehensive and consistent design system across the website,  
**So that** we present a cohesive, professional brand identity that reinforces trust and credibility with potential clients.

## Priority: High (P01)
High priority because a consistent design system is foundational to all visual improvements and directly impacts brand perception. The current website has inconsistencies in visual elements that could be strengthened through a standardized system.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a comprehensive style guide documenting all design elements
- Define expanded color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors with specific use cases
- Establish typography hierarchy with specific fonts, weights, and sizes for different content types
- Standardize spacing and layout grids across all pages
- Define consistent UI component styles (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- Include visual examples of correct and incorrect usage
- Document animation principles and motion guidelines
- Establish responsive design breakpoints and behavior

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- The design system should reflect TitanTech's positioning as a technical expert with a focus on pairing junior developers with senior mentors
- Consider creating reusable UI components that the development team can easily implement
- Should align with the current blue-focused color scheme but potentially enhance it for better visual hierarchy
- Focus on creating a system that balances modern tech aesthetics with professionalism and accessibility
