# Visual Content Enhancement

## Story Identifier: VD-00006-Visual-Content-Enhancement

**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** see high-quality, relevant visual content throughout the website,  
**So that** I can better understand TitanTech's services and develop confidence in their professional capabilities.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Visual content significantly impacts user engagement and understanding, but this enhancement builds upon the core design system work, hence the medium priority.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a consistent style guide for imagery (photography, illustrations, icons)
- Replace placeholder or generic images with custom photography or high-quality stock images
- Develop custom illustrations to explain complex service offerings and processes
- Implement a cohesive icon system throughout the site
- Create branded diagrams to visualize the development process and methodologies
- Optimize all images for web performance (compression, responsive sizing)
- Ensure all visual content has appropriate alt text for accessibility
- Create visual showcases of successful projects (before/after, results visualization)
- Implement subtle background patterns or textures that enhance rather than distract
- Develop consistent data visualizations for metrics and results

## Notes:
- Focus on visuals that demonstrate the mentor-junior pairing model's benefits
- Balance technical imagery with human elements to showcase both expertise and the team
- Consider creating a small set of branded illustrations that can be used throughout the site
- Use visuals strategically to break up text and enhance understanding
- Ensure visual content is meaningful and adds value, not just decorative
