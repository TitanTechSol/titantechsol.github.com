# Performance Audit and Optimization Strategy

## Story Identifier: PO-00001-Performance-Audit-Strategy

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** conduct a comprehensive performance audit and develop an optimization strategy,  
**So that** we can identify performance bottlenecks and prioritize optimization efforts to create a faster, more responsive website experience for our users.

## Priority: High (P01)
This is a high priority because performance directly impacts user experience, engagement, and conversion rates. Establishing baseline metrics and a strategic approach to optimization is critical before implementing specific improvements.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete performance audit using Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools
- Establish baseline performance metrics including First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Time to Interactive (TTI), and Core Web Vitals
- Identify top 5 performance bottlenecks with prioritized recommendations
- Document current bundle sizes and load times for all major site sections
- Create a prioritized optimization roadmap with estimated impact for each recommendation
- Document mobile vs. desktop performance differences
- Establish performance budgets for key metrics
- Set up automated performance testing in the CI/CD pipeline 
- Document findings in a comprehensive report with recommendations

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Focus on both perceived and actual performance metrics
- Consider business impact when prioritizing optimizations
- Include before/after comparisons in the final report
- Use real user data when available in addition to lab testing
- Consider setting up a staging environment that closely mimics production for accurate testing
