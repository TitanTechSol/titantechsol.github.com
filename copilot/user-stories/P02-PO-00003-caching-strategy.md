# Browser Caching and CDN Strategy

## Story Identifier: PO-00003-Caching-Strategy

**As a** returning website visitor,  
**I want to** experience faster page loads on repeat visits,  
**So that** I can quickly access content I've seen before without unnecessary downloads.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Proper caching strategy improves performance for returning visitors and reduces server load. This is medium priority as it primarily benefits returning users rather than first-time visitors.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement appropriate Cache-Control headers for different asset types
- Configure proper ETags and Last-Modified headers
- Set up cache busting for versioned assets through filename hashing
- Configure service worker for offline access to critical assets
- Document caching strategy for different asset types (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts)
- Set up appropriate CDN caching policies if applicable
- Verify repeat visit performance improvements across browsers
- Ensure admin users can force-refresh when needed during development
- Test and document caching behavior with GitHub Pages hosting

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy

## Notes:
- Consider implementing a service worker carefully to avoid caching issues during updates
- Ensure GitHub Pages configuration supports the caching strategy
- Document how developers should handle cache invalidation when updating content
- Consider different caching strategies for different site sections
- Evaluate if a CDN solution would provide additional benefits beyond GitHub Pages
