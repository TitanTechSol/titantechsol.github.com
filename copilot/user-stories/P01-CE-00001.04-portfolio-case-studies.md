**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** view detailed case studies of past projects completed by TitanTech Solutions,  
**So that** I can understand their approach and evaluate their capacity to solve my business problems.

## Priority: High (P01)
Case studies demonstrate proven expertise and practical application of services, which is crucial for conversion.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Develop at least 4-6 detailed case studies representing different service areas
- Structure each case study with: Challenge, Approach, Solution, and Results sections
- Include specific technologies used in each project
- Highlight the role of the senior mentor/junior developer pairing in each project
- Include measurable outcomes and client benefits for each case study
- Add visual elements (diagrams, screenshots, etc.) to illustrate the solutions
- Implement filtering options to browse case studies by industry, technology, or service type

## Dependencies:
