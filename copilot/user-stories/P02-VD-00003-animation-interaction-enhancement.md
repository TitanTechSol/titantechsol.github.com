# Animation and Interaction Enhancement

## Story Identifier: VD-00003-Animation-Interaction-Enhancement

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** experience subtle, purposeful animations and interactions throughout my journey,  
**So that** I can better understand content relationships, state changes, and feel engaged with a modern, polished website.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Animation and interactions enhance the user experience and perception of quality, but aren't as critical as core visual consistency elements, hence the medium priority.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define a cohesive animation philosophy that supports rather than distracts from content
- Implement consistent transition effects for page navigation and content loading
- Create subtle micro-interactions for hovering over interactive elements
- Add meaningful animations for state changes (form submission, error states, etc.)
- Ensure all animations respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Optimize animations for performance (using transform and opacity properties)
- Implement loading states/skeletons for content that may take time to load
- Document animation duration, easing, and timing standards
- Ensure animations are consistent across browsers
- Add scroll-based animations for key content sections where appropriate

## Dependencies:
- P01-VD-00001-design-system-enhancement

## Notes:
- Current site has some animations but they're not consistently applied
- Focus on subtle, meaningful animations rather than flashy effects
- Use animations to guide users' attention and provide feedback
- Consider implementing animation libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion if performance allows
- Pay special attention to maintaining 60fps performance, especially on mobile devices
