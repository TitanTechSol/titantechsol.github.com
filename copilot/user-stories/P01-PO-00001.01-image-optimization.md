# Image Asset Optimization 

## Story Identifier: PO-00001.01-Image-Optimization

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** experience fast-loading images throughout the website,  
**So that** I can browse the content without delays and enjoy a smooth user experience on any device or connection speed.

## Priority: High (P01)
Images constitute a significant portion of page weight and have a direct impact on key performance metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). Optimizing images is often one of the highest-ROI performance improvements.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement responsive images with appropriate srcset and sizes attributes
- Convert all JPG/PNG images to next-gen formats (WebP with fallbacks)
- Implement lazy loading for all below-the-fold images
- Optimize all images to maintain visual quality while reducing file size (at least 30% size reduction)
- Establish and document an image optimization workflow for future content
- Verify no horizontal scrolling or layout shifts caused by images
- Implement appropriate caching headers for images
- Ensure proper image dimensions are used (no scaling down of large images via CSS)
- Improve Largest Contentful Paint metric by at least 20%

## Dependencies:

## Notes:
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery if not already in place
- Evaluate tools like Squoosh or ImageOptim for optimization
- The team background image and header background should be prioritized as they affect LCP
- Consider implementing a server-side or build-time image optimization solution
- Test improvements across various device types and connection speeds
