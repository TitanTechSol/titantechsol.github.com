# Code Splitting and Component Lazy Loading

## Story Identifier: PO-00001.02-Code-Splitting-Lazy-Loading

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** only download the JavaScript required for the current page,  
**So that** initial page load is faster and I can interact with the website sooner.

## Priority: High (P01)
JavaScript is often a major bottleneck for initial page load and interactivity. Implementing code splitting will significantly improve Time to Interactive and reduce initial bundle size.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement route-based code splitting for all main routes using React.lazy and Suspense
- Add loading states/skeletons for lazily loaded components
- Implement component-level code splitting for large components (e.g., interactive services section, team cards, portfolio items)
- Reduce main bundle size by at least 30%
- Verify that Time to Interactive improves by at least 25%
- Ensure error boundaries are in place to handle loading failures gracefully
- Document the code splitting strategy for developers
- Ensure no regression in functionality or user experience
- Optimize dynamic import loading priorities based on user navigation patterns

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy (parent story)

## Notes:
- Special attention should be paid to the interactive components like service explorer and team cards
- Consider using webpack bundle analyzer to identify splitting opportunities
- Ensure the loading experience is smooth and doesn't cause layout shifts
- This may require updates to the webpack configuration for optimal chunking
- Consider preloading critical chunks based on likely user navigation paths
