# Lead Scoring Implementation

## Story Identifier: CO-00002.02-Lead-Scoring-Implementation

**As a** sales team member,  
**I want to** have an automated lead scoring system based on website behavior,  
**So that** I can prioritize follow-up with the most qualified leads and improve conversion to clients.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Lead scoring improves sales efficiency and conversion rates for leads that have already been captured. This is medium priority as it enhances rather than generates initial conversions.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define lead scoring criteria based on demographic information and behavioral signals
- Implement tracking of key behavioral indicators (page visits, content downloads, repeat visits)
- Create scoring rules that assign point values to different user actions
- Set up lead categorization based on score thresholds (cold, warm, hot)
- Implement lead score visualization in admin dashboard
- Create automated notifications for high-scoring leads
- Establish lead score degradation rules for aging leads
- Set up integration with CRM system for lead data synchronization
- Develop different follow-up sequences based on lead score categories
- Create reporting to measure correlation between lead scores and conversion rates

## Dependencies:
- P02-CO-00002-conversion-analytics (parent story)

## Notes:
- Scoring should consider both fit (right type of company/project) and engagement (level of interest)
- Special attention should be paid to behavior indicating technical decision-maker engagement
- Consider implementing progressive profiling to gather more lead information over time
- Lead scoring should be periodically calibrated based on which scores actually convert to clients
- Consider both explicit (form submissions) and implicit (content consumption) signals in scoring
