# Web Analytics Integration

## Story Identifier: IN-00001-Analytics-Integration

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** implement comprehensive web analytics tracking on our website,  
**So that** I can measure user behavior, campaign effectiveness, and conversion rates to make data-driven improvement decisions.

## Priority: High (P01)
Analytics implementation is high priority because it provides the foundation for measuring all website effectiveness, validating improvements, and understanding user behavior. Without proper tracking, we cannot quantify the impact of other website enhancements or understand where users are encountering friction.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Select and implement an appropriate analytics platform (Google Analytics 4 recommended)
- Set up proper site tracking code on all website pages with appropriate privacy controls
- Configure basic conversion tracking for key actions (form submissions, service page visits)
- Establish user journey tracking to understand navigation paths through the site
- Implement UTM parameter support for tracking marketing campaign effectiveness
- Create a basic reporting dashboard for key metrics
- Document the analytics implementation and reporting procedures for team members
- Ensure GDPR compliance with proper user consent mechanisms

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Consider legal requirements for user consent and tracking based on target markets
- Ensure all team members have appropriate access levels to analytics
- Focus on actionable metrics rather than vanity metrics
- Consider the balance between comprehensive tracking and site performance
- Include documentation on how to implement tracking for future site additions
