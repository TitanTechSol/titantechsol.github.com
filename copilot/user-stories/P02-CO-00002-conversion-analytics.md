# Conversion Analytics Implementation

## Story Identifier: CO-00002-Conversion-Analytics

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** implement comprehensive conversion tracking and analytics,  
**So that** I can measure the effectiveness of conversion optimization efforts and make data-driven improvements.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
While analytics are essential for optimization, this is medium priority as it supports rather than directly drives conversion improvements. Analytics implementation should follow initial conversion optimizations.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Set up goal tracking for all primary and secondary conversion points
- Implement event tracking for key user interactions and micro-conversions
- Create custom dimensions for tracking user segments and behaviors
- Set up funnel visualization to identify drop-off points in the conversion process
- Implement heat mapping and session recording for qualitative analysis
- Create a conversion dashboard with key metrics and visualizations
- Set up regular automated reports for conversion performance
- Implement UTM parameter tracking for marketing campaign effectiveness
- Create attribution modeling to understand the user journey to conversion
- Establish baseline metrics and improvement targets for key conversion points

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Ensure analytics implementation complies with privacy regulations
- Focus on actionable metrics rather than vanity metrics
- Consider implementing both Google Analytics and a specialized conversion optimization tool
- Establish a regular cadence for reviewing analytics and implementing improvements
- Integrate analytics data with CRM where applicable to track full customer journey
