# Team Profile Management System

## Story Identifier: CM-00001.01-Team-Profile-Management

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** easily update team member profiles, photos, and credentials,  
**So that** our website always reflects our current team composition and expertise accurately.

## Priority: High (P01)
Team profiles are a critical component of establishing credibility and showcasing expertise. The current implementation requires developer intervention to update, which delays updates and creates unnecessary work.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a structured content model for team profiles in the CMS
- Implement fields for name, title, photo, bio, specialties, years of experience, and technology tags
- Enable drag-and-drop reordering of team members
- Provide image upload and cropping functionality for team photos
- Allow scheduling of profile changes for future publishing (e.g., when new team members join)
- Ensure changes in the CMS automatically update the website without developer intervention
- Update the current team component to pull data from the CMS instead of hardcoded files
- Maintain the existing "flip card" functionality with new CMS-driven data

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration (parent story)

## Notes:
- The existing team section uses a flip card design with front/back content
- Consider implementing validation for required fields
- Team photos should maintain consistent dimensions and quality
- Preserve the existing technology tag functionality
