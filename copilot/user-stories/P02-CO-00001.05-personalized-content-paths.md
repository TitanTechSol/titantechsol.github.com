# Personalized Content Paths

## Story Identifier: CO-00001.05-Personalized-Content-Paths

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** experience content that's relevant to my specific role and needs,  
**So that** I can quickly determine if TitanTech Solutions is the right fit for my project.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Personalization can significantly improve conversion rates by showing visitors the most relevant content. This is medium priority as it requires content segmentation and technical implementation.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement a lightweight preference selection mechanism for first-time visitors
- Create distinct content paths for technical and business stakeholder personas
- Design intelligent content recommendations based on browsing behavior
- Add role-specific CTAs that address the unique concerns of different user types
- Build a "content hub" that organizes resources by role and industry
- Implement cookie-based persistence of user preferences between sessions
- Create specialized landing pages for different visitor segments
- Provide industry-specific examples and case studies based on visitor preferences
- Add a "recommended for you" section on key pages based on user behavior

## Notes:
- Focus on subtle personalization that doesn't feel intrusive or require extensive personal information
- Consider the different decision criteria for technical vs. business stakeholders
- Personalization should feel helpful rather than creepy - be transparent about how content is being tailored
- Ensure all personalization features comply with privacy regulations
- Test personalized vs. generic content paths to validate conversion improvement
