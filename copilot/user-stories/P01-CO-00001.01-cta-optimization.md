# Call-to-Action Optimization

## Story Identifier: CO-00001.01-CTA-Optimization

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** see clear, compelling calls-to-action throughout my journey on the website,  
**So that** I understand what steps to take when I'm ready to engage with TitanTech Solutions.

## Priority: High (P01)
High-converting CTAs are critical for guiding user behavior and improving conversion rates. Current CTAs could be more strategically placed and more compelling in their messaging.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement a primary CTA button with high visual prominence on the homepage above the fold
- Create contextual secondary CTAs for each service section that relate directly to that service
- Design a hierarchy of CTA styles (primary, secondary, tertiary) with consistent visual language
- Optimize CTA button text beyond generic "Learn More" or "Contact Us" to communicate specific value
- Implement strategic CTA placement following the natural F-pattern and Z-pattern reading flows
- Add hover states and micro-animations to CTAs to improve engagement
- Ensure all CTAs have appropriate tracking for conversion analysis
- A/B test at least two versions of the primary homepage CTA to determine optimal performance

## Dependencies:
- P01-CO-00001-conversion-strategy (parent story)

## Notes:
- CTAs should reflect the mentorship-focused business model where appropriate
- Mobile CTAs need special consideration for touch targets and visibility
- Consider sticky CTAs for longer content pages
- Balance frequency of CTAs to avoid overwhelming users while still providing clear paths to conversion
