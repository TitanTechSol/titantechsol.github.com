# Testimonial Management System

## Story Identifier: CM-00001.04-Testimonial-Management

**As a** marketing coordinator,  
**I want to** add, edit, and publish client testimonials,  
**So that** we can showcase client satisfaction and build trust with potential customers.

## Priority: High (P01)
Testimonials provide social proof that is critical for conversion. The current implementation appears to have placeholder content or empty states, indicating a need to easily add real testimonials as they become available.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a structured content model for testimonials in the CMS
- Implement fields for client name, position, company, testimonial text, and optional client photo
- Allow for approval workflow before testimonials go live
- Enable drag-and-drop reordering of testimonials to control display priority
- Update the testimonials component to pull data from the CMS instead of hardcoded content
- Maintain the existing carousel/rotation functionality with CMS-driven data
- Ensure appropriate empty states when no testimonials are available

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration (parent story)

## Notes:
- The current site appears to have a testimonial carousel with rotation functionality
- Consider adding testimonial categories to allow filtering by service type
- Ensure client approval is documented before publishing testimonials
- Include option to anonymize testimonials when clients prefer not to be named
