# A/B Testing Framework Implementation

## Story Identifier: CO-00002.01-AB-Testing-Framework

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** implement an A/B testing framework for key conversion elements,  
**So that** I can continuously improve conversion rates based on data rather than assumptions.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
A/B testing is valuable for optimizing conversion elements, but requires baseline implementation of those elements first, hence the medium priority.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Select and implement an appropriate A/B testing tool compatible with the website architecture
- Create a testing calendar with prioritized elements to test
- Set up proper statistical significance parameters to ensure reliable results
- Implement first A/B test on the primary homepage CTA
- Set up second A/B test on the contact form design
- Create a documentation process for test hypotheses, variations, and results
- Implement proper segmentation to ensure users see consistent experiences
- Set up automated test result reporting
- Develop a process for implementing winning variations and planning follow-up tests
- Create a knowledge base of test results to inform future design decisions

## Dependencies:
- P02-CO-00002-conversion-analytics (parent story)

## Notes:
- Focus initial tests on high-impact, high-traffic areas for quickest learning
- Ensure tests run long enough to achieve statistical significance
- Consider multivariate testing for complex elements once A/B testing is established
- Test should be planned with clear hypotheses rather than random variations
- Consider testing different messaging approaches for different audience segments
