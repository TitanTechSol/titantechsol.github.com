# Critical CSS Path Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00001.03-Critical-CSS-Optimization

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** see the website render quickly without waiting for stylesheets to load,  
**So that** I can start consuming content without perceiving a delay.

## Priority: High (P01)
Render-blocking CSS is a common performance bottleneck that affects First Contentful Paint and user perception of site speed. Extracting and inlining critical CSS can significantly improve perceived performance.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Identify and extract critical CSS for above-the-fold content on key pages (home, services, contact)
- Inline critical CSS in the HTML to eliminate render-blocking CSS for initial viewport
- Defer non-critical CSS loading to improve First Contentful Paint by at least 20%
- Implement a solution to prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
- Reduce unused CSS across the site by at least 15%
- Verify improvements on both mobile and desktop devices
- Document the approach for maintaining critical CSS with future updates
- Ensure no regression in styling functionality across browsers

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy (parent story)

## Notes:
- Consider tools like Critical, CriticalCSS, or Penthouse for extraction
- May require changes to the webpack build process
- Consider implementing CSS code splitting to match JavaScript code splitting
- Test thoroughly across multiple browsers and devices to ensure no visual regressions
- Consider future maintenance overhead when choosing an implementation approach
