# Lead Scoring System Implementation

## Story Identifier: IN-00002.02-Lead-Scoring

**As a** sales team member,  
**I want to** implement an automated lead scoring system that integrates website behavior data,  
**So that** I can prioritize leads based on their engagement level and likelihood to convert.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Inherits priority from parent story, as lead scoring enhances the value of the basic CRM integration.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define lead scoring criteria based on demographic information and behavioral signals
- Implement tracking of key behavioral indicators (page visits, content downloads, repeat visits)
- Create scoring rules that assign point values to different user actions
- Set up lead categorization based on score thresholds (cold, warm, hot)
- Implement lead score visualization in CRM dashboard
- Create automated notifications for high-scoring leads
- Establish lead score degradation rules for aging leads
- Set up CRM workflows based on lead score changes
- Create reports to measure correlation between lead scores and conversion rates
- Document the scoring methodology and maintenance procedures

## Dependencies:
- P02-IN-00002-crm-integration (parent story)
- P02-IN-00002.01-form-to-crm-connection
- P01-IN-00001-analytics-integration

## Notes:
- Scoring should consider both fit (right type of company/project) and engagement (level of interest)
- Special attention should be paid to behavior indicating technical decision-maker engagement
- Consider implementing progressive profiling to gather more lead information over time
- Lead scoring should be periodically calibrated based on which scores actually convert to clients
- Consider both explicit (form submissions) and implicit (content consumption) signals in scoring
