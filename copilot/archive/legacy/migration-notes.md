- **Specialized Knowledge**: Technical and business expertise maintained in context documents

## New Behavior-Based Structure

### Core SOW Behaviors (4)
1. **SOW Planning & Strategy** (`behaviors/sow-planning-strategy.md`)
   - Strategic opportunity assessment and business case development
   - Competitive positioning and value proposition development
   - Market analysis and business value assessment
   - Risk and opportunity planning

2. **Technical Architecture & Design** (`behaviors/technical-architecture-design.md`)
   - System architecture design and technology selection
   - Technical risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Integration architecture and implementation planning
   - Technical documentation and communication

3. **Quality Assurance & Testing** (`behaviors/quality-assurance-testing.md`)
   - Quality strategy development and testing planning
   - Risk-based testing and quality validation
   - Quality process integration and metrics
   - Testing automation and manual testing approaches

4. **Client Communication & Stakeholder Management** (`behaviors/client-communication-stakeholder-management.md`)
   - Stakeholder analysis and engagement planning
   - Client communication strategy and expectation management
   - Issue resolution and escalation management
   - Relationship building and maintenance

### Integrated Workflow (`workflows/integrated-sow-development.md`)
- 5-phase SOW development process
- Cross-behavior coordination and integration
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Success metrics and continuous improvement framework

### Context Documents (`context/business-context.md`)
- Consolidated company and service information
- Team capabilities and expertise mapping
- Market position and competitive landscape
- Business model and operational context

## Benefits of New Approach

### Efficiency Improvements
- **Reduced Overhead**: Direct AI interaction without agent simulation complexity
- **Better Context**: Comprehensive context in single behavior session
- **Faster Processing**: Elimination of agent coordination and role switching
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Integrated process vs. fragmented agent interactions

### Quality Enhancements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: All relevant perspectives in single analysis
- **Consistent Output**: Standardized behavior templates ensure consistency
- **Better Validation**: Human oversight built into behavior workflows
- **Integrated Approach**: Cross-functional considerations in each behavior

### Maintainability Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidated knowledge in behavior templates
- **Easier Updates**: Update behaviors rather than multiple agent definitions
- **Version Control**: Track behavior evolution and improvements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Easier to share and replicate successful behaviors

## Legacy Structure Preservation

The original agent crew structure has been preserved in the `legacy/crew/` directory for:
- **Reference**: Ability to reference original agent definitions if needed
- **Knowledge Mining**: Further extraction of valuable patterns and insights
- **Comparison**: Ability to compare approaches and validate migration completeness
- **Training**: Historical example of agent crew approach for educational purposes

### Files Preserved:
- `legacy/crew/business/` - All 6 business agent definitions
- `legacy/crew/technical/` - All 10 technical agent definitions
- `legacy/documents/templates/` - Original template files
- Original agent interaction patterns and role definitions
- Communication styles and collaboration approaches
