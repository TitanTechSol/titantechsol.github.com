# Newsletter Subscription Form Implementation

## Story Identifier: AF-00004.01-Subscription-Forms

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** easily subscribe to the newsletter from various points throughout the website,  
**So that** I can receive valuable content without hunting for a subscription page.

## Priority: Low (P04)
This follows the priority of the parent newsletter system story.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create consistent newsletter signup forms for multiple website locations
- Implement at least 4 strategic placement locations (footer, blog sidebar, popup, dedicated page)
- Design forms to be visually appealing while maintaining accessibility standards
- Include clear value proposition explaining benefits of subscribing
- Implement form validation with helpful error messages
- Create success state with clear next steps after subscription
- Ensure forms work properly on all devices and screen sizes
- Add progressive profiling to gather additional information over time
- Implement conversion tracking for each subscription form location
- Create A/B testing capability for form designs and copy

## Dependencies:
- P04-AF-00004-newsletter-system (parent story)

## Notes:
- Forms should be minimally intrusive while still being visible
- Consider timed or exit-intent triggers for popup forms
- Balance information collected with friction (start with just email)
- Clearly communicate privacy practices and email frequency
- Test forms thoroughly to ensure they don't interfere with other page elements
