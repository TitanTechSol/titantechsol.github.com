# Mobile Performance Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00006-Mobile-Optimization

**As a** mobile website visitor,  
**I want to** experience fast loading and responsive interaction even on slower mobile connections,  
**So that** I can efficiently learn about TitanTech's services and contact them without frustration.

## Priority: Low (P03)
While mobile optimization is important, this is rated P03 because many mobile-specific optimizations will be addressed in other stories. This focuses on remaining mobile-specific issues.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Test and optimize for various mobile network conditions (3G, 4G, etc.)
- Implement connection-aware loading strategies
- Optimize touch interactions for faster response times
- Reduce or defer non-essential content on mobile views
- Ensure smooth scrolling and animations on mobile devices
- Optimize input elements for mobile interaction (form fields, buttons, etc.)
- Test and verify performance on low-end mobile devices
- Ensure CPU and memory usage are optimized for mobile constraints
- Document mobile-specific optimizations and testing procedures
- Improve mobile Lighthouse performance score by at least 15 points

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy
- P01-PO-00001.01-image-optimization

## Notes:
- Focus on both perceived performance and actual metrics
- Consider implementing "Save-Data" header detection
- Test on real devices, not just emulators
- Pay special attention to the interactive components like the services explorer
- Consider implementing skeleton screens for slower connections
