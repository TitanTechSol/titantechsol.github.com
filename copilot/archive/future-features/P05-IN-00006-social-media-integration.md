# Social Media Platform Integration

## Story Identifier: IN-00006-Social-Media

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** integrate social media sharing and display capabilities into our website,  
**So that** we can increase content reach and demonstrate our active presence on professional networks.

## Priority: Very Low (P05)
Social media integration provides value but is less critical than other integrations for a B2B software development company, hence the lowest priority.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Add social sharing buttons to blog posts, case studies, and other shareable content
- Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for optimized social sharing
- Create social follow buttons in the website footer and contact pages
- Add LinkedIn company profile widget to relevant pages
- Implement social media feed display for selected platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Configure proper UTM parameters for all social sharing links
- Create custom share messages that include relevant hashtags
- Design share buttons that match the website's visual identity
- Ensure all social integrations are responsive and function across devices
- Track social sharing events in analytics platform

## Dependencies:
- P01-IN-00001-analytics-integration (for tracking social interactions)

## Notes:
- Focus primarily on professional networks like LinkedIn rather than all social platforms
- Consider the balance between encouraging sharing and cluttering the interface
- Ensure sharing previews are tested across all major social platforms
- Privacy considerations should be evaluated for any embedded social content
- Consider developing a social content calendar that aligns with website content strategy
