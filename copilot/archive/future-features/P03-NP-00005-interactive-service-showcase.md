# Interactive Service Showcase and Demo Platform

## Story Identifier: NP-00005-Interactive-Showcase

**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** interact with demonstrations of TitanTech's capabilities,  
**So that** I can better understand their technical expertise and approach to software development.

## Priority: Low (P03)
While valuable for demonstrating capabilities, this is lower priority than core website functionality and improvements directly tied to lead generation and conversion.

## Story Points: 8

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a framework for interactive code demos and technical showcases
- Develop at least 3 interactive demonstrations of technical capabilities
- Implement a guided walkthrough experience for each showcase
- Build sandboxed environments for safe code execution where applicable
- Create before/after examples for development and architecture improvements
- Implement visual representation of the junior-senior collaboration process
- Design explanatory content to accompany technical demonstrations
- Ensure all showcases are responsive and work across devices
- Create analytics to track engagement with interactive elements
- Implement lead capture mechanisms integrated with demonstrations

## Dependencies:
- Core website implementation must be complete
- Technical content strategy should be established

## Notes:
- Focus on demonstrations that highlight TitanTech's key differentiators
- Consider creating both highly technical demos for developer audiences and conceptual demos for business stakeholders
- Ensure security of any interactive code execution environments
- Balance technical impressiveness with accessibility for non-technical visitors
- Interactive elements should clearly demonstrate the benefits of the junior-senior pairing model
