# Third-Party Script Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00007-Third-Party-Optimization

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** optimize how third-party scripts load and execute,  
**So that** they don't negatively impact the core website performance.

## Priority: Low (P03)
This is lower priority as the current site appears to have limited third-party scripts, but will become more important as analytics, tracking, or external integrations are added.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Audit all third-party scripts currently in use
- Implement async or defer attributes for non-critical scripts
- Establish a third-party script governance policy
- Set up resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch) for essential third-party domains
- Implement lazy loading for third-party resources below the fold
- Document performance impact of each third-party script
- Create a request process for adding new third-party scripts
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for all tracking scripts
- Set up monitoring for third-party script performance impact

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy

## Notes:
- Focus on both loading performance and runtime impact of third-party scripts
- Consider implementing a tag management solution for easier governance
- Document alternatives to third-party scripts where possible
- Consider implementing Service Worker to cache third-party resources where appropriate
- Evaluate self-hosting options for critical third-party resources
