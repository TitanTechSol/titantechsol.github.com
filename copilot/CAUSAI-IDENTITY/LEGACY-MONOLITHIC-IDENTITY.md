## CRITICAL WORKFLOW CHECKLIST - READ EVERY TIME

### RULE 1: COMMIT PROCESS (MANDATORY STEPS - NO EXCEPTIONS)
**CANNOT commit changes without human confirmation**

**STEP 1**: Build and Deploy (if core files changed)
- If ANY changes to: src/, package.json, webpack.config.js, server.js, .babelrc, .gitignore, CNAME, package-lock.json, package-scripts.json, quick-site-test.sh, Readme.md
- Then MUST: `npm run build` → Deploy to GitHub Pages → BEFORE committing

**STEP 2**: Show Changes to Human
- Show visual changes (live website link)
- Show code changes summary
- Explain what was modified and why

**STEP 3**: Wait for Explicit Human Approval
- Do NOT proceed without clear "yes" or "good to go"
- Human must verify website works correctly

**STEP 4**: Commit with Detailed Description
- Explain what changed and why
- Reference the approval process completed

### RULE 2: COMMIT FREQUENCY
- When 10+ files changed AND website works → commit immediately
- Never commit 60+ files in single commit
- Break large changes into logical chunks

### RULE 3: CONTENT STANDARDS
- NO ICONS, emojis, or special characters in ANY files or commits
- Text only - clean professional formatting
- No decorative symbols anywhere

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW CHECKLIST

### Every Task Must Follow This Sequence:
1. **Analyze** user story requirements
2. **Plan** implementation approach  
3. **Implement** code changes
4. **Test** using local development server
5. **Follow RULE 1 Commit Process** (all 4 steps)

### Triple Check Protocol:
- **Check 1**: Technical - Does it work as intended?
- **Check 2**: Visual - Does it look right and function properly?
- **Check 3**: Quality - Is code clean and maintainable?

## CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLES

### Human Interaction
- Minimize human input except for: task assignment, final approval, critical decisions
- ALWAYS show visual changes AND code changes before committing
- Wait for explicit human confirmation before any commits

### Quality Standards
- Maintain organized, clean codebase
- Follow established naming conventions
- Make content readable for both humans and AI
- NEVER remove features without explicit confirmation

### File Organization (MANDATORY)
- All .md files → proper copilot subdirectories
- Completion docs → `.\copilot\completed\summaries\`
- Planning docs → `.\copilot\docs\planning\`
- User Stories → `.\copilot\user-stories\`
- Work Items → `.\copilot\work-items\`
- NEVER create files in project root (except Readme.md)

### Continuous Improvement
- ALWAYS incorporate constructive feedback into this file
- Document lessons learned and process improvements
- Learn from mistakes to improve future work quality

├── completed/                  # Finished work documentation
└── archive/                    # Historical content and future-features/
```

### File Organization Rules
- All .md files → proper copilot subdirectories
- NEVER create files in project root (except Readme.md)
- Determine proper folder BEFORE creating any file
- Keep workspace focused on P01-P02 active stories

## STATUS UPDATES & COMMUNICATION

### Required Communication Points
1. **Before starting** any user story implementation
2. **After completing** implementation (show visual + code changes)
3. **Before committing** any changes to repository
