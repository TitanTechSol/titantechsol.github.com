# COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL & STATUS REPORTING

## CORE COMMUNICATION RULES

### Rule 1: Always Show Your Work
**NEVER commit code changes without showing the user what changed**

1. **Build/Deploy First**: Run necessary build processes
2. **Show Changes**: Display what files were modified and how
3. **Get Approval**: Wait for explicit user confirmation
4. **Then Commit**: Only commit after approval received

### Rule 2: Transparent Progress Updates
Provide clear status updates throughout work sessions:
- **Starting work**: "Beginning [task description]"
- **Progress markers**: "Completed [specific milestone]" 
- **Completion**: "Finished [task], ready for review"
- **Blocked**: "Need input on [specific issue]"
