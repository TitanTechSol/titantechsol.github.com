# Priority Management System - ADO Enhanced

**Last Updated**: July 30, 2025  
**Created by**: CAUSAI  
**Version**: 1.0  

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority System Overview

Our priority system combines the best of ADO work item management with our custom CAUSAI workflow automation.

### Priority Levels (Enhanced ADO Style)

| Priority | Level | ADO Equivalent | Description | Business Impact | Timeline |
|----------|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **P01** | ðŸ”¥ Critical | Priority 1 | Blocking issues, urgent business needs | High revenue/reputation impact | 1-3 days |
| **P02** | âš¡ High | Priority 2 | Important features, significant improvements | Medium business value | 1-2 weeks |
| **P03** | ðŸ“‹ Medium | Priority 3 | Standard features, moderate improvements | Low-medium business value | 2-4 weeks |
| **P04** | ðŸ’¡ Low | Priority 4 | Nice-to-have, minor enhancements | Nice-to-have improvements | Future sprints |

### Enhanced Priority Indicators

#### Visual Status System
- ðŸ”¥ **P01 - Critical**: Red styling, urgent action required
- âš¡ **P02 - High**: Orange styling, important work
- ðŸ“‹ **P03 - Medium**: Blue styling, standard priority
- ðŸ’¡ **P04 - Low**: Green styling, future consideration

#### Priority Triggers
**P01 (Critical) - Auto-Escalation Triggers:**
- Production issues blocking users
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Revenue-impacting problems
- Client-facing functionality failures

**P02 (High) - Business Value Triggers:**
- Key feature requests from major clients
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- Integration requirements for business operations
- Conversion optimization opportunities

**P03 (Medium) - Enhancement Triggers:**
- User experience improvements
- Code quality and maintainability
- Non-critical feature additions
- Documentation and testing improvements

**P04 (Low) - Future Planning:**
- Experimental features
- Research and development
- Nice-to-have UI enhancements
- Advanced features with unclear ROI

## ðŸ”„ ADO-Style Priority Workflow

### 1. Priority Assignment Rules
```
Business Impact Ã— Urgency = Priority Level

High Impact + High Urgency = P01 (Critical)
High Impact + Medium Urgency = P02 (High)
Medium Impact + High Urgency = P02 (High)
Medium Impact + Medium Urgency = P03 (Medium)
Low Impact + Any Urgency = P04 (Low)
```

### 2. Priority Escalation Process
- **Automatic Escalation**: System issues, production bugs
- **Business Escalation**: Client requests, revenue opportunities
- **Time-based Escalation**: P03 items sitting for 30+ days review for P02
- **Stakeholder Escalation**: Leadership can override priority assignments

### 3. Priority Review Cycle
- **Daily**: P01 items reviewed for completion status
- **Weekly**: P02 items reviewed for progress and blocking issues
- **Bi-weekly**: P03/P04 items reviewed for priority adjustment
- **Monthly**: Full backlog priority reassessment

## ðŸš€ CAUSAI Priority Integration

### Automated Priority Commands
```bash
# Start highest priority item
causai start next-priority

# Start specific priority level
causai start priority P01
causai start priority P02

# Priority management
causai priority list
causai priority escalate P03-CE-00001 to P02
causai priority review overdue

# Sprint planning
causai sprint plan --capacity 20 --priority P01,P02
causai sprint status --show-priority
```

### Priority-Based Automation Rules

#### P01 (Critical) Automation
- **Immediate Start**: Auto-assigns to CAUSAI when created
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Status checks every 4 hours
- **Escalation Alerts**: Notify human if blocked > 2 hours
- **Override Authority**: Human can interrupt other work

#### P02 (High) Automation
- **Queue Management**: Auto-queues after P01 completion
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily status updates required
- **Dependency Resolution**: Auto-identifies and resolves dependencies
- **Sprint Commitment**: Must be included in current sprint

#### P03/P04 Automation
- **Background Processing**: Work on during low-priority time
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar items for efficiency
- **Periodic Review**: Auto-suggest priority changes
- **Resource Allocation**: Fill remaining sprint capacity

## ðŸ“ˆ Priority Metrics & Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Priority Distribution**: % of work items by priority level
- **Cycle Time by Priority**: Average completion time per priority
- **Priority Escalation Rate**: How often items get escalated
- **Business Value Delivery**: Completed value by priority level

### Automated Reports
```bash
# Daily priority dashboard
causai report priority-dashboard

# Sprint velocity by priority
causai report sprint-velocity --by-priority

# Priority aging report
causai report priority-aging

# Business value delivered
causai report business-value --period this-sprint
```

### Priority Health Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **Healthy**: P01 items < 3 days, P02 items < 2 weeks
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning**: Aging items approaching SLA limits
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Overdue items requiring immediate attention

## ðŸ”§ Integration with Existing Tools

### Discussion System Integration
- Priority changes automatically logged in discussions
- Priority-based comment filtering and notifications
- Escalation history tracked in work item discussions

### Workflow Script Integration
```bash
# Enhanced causai-workflow.sh commands
./causai-workflow.sh --priority P01 --start-next
./causai-workflow.sh --priority-review --show-aging
./causai-workflow.sh --sprint-planning --capacity 25
```

### File Structure Integration
```
work-items/
â”œâ”€â”€ P01-critical/          # Critical priority items
â”œâ”€â”€ P02-high/             # High priority items  
â”œâ”€â”€ P03-medium/           # Medium priority items
â”œâ”€â”€ P04-low/              # Low priority items
â”œâ”€â”€ priority-reports/      # Automated priority reports
â””â”€â”€ escalation-log/       # Priority change history
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Planning with Priorities

### Capacity Planning by Priority
```
Sprint Capacity: 25 story points
- P01 (Critical): 40% = 10 points (must include)
- P02 (High): 40% = 10 points (should include)  
- P03 (Medium): 15% = 4 points (nice to include)
- P04 (Low): 5% = 1 point (fill remaining capacity)
```

### Priority Commitment Rules
1. **All P01 items MUST be completed** in current sprint
2. **P02 items** should be completed unless blocked
3. **P03 items** are stretch goals for remaining capacity
4. **P04 items** are background tasks for idle time

## ðŸ¤– CAUSAI Priority Decision Engine

### Automated Priority Assignment
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for priority assignment logic
function assignPriority(workItem) {
  if (workItem.isProductionIssue || workItem.isSecurityIssue) {
    return 'P01';
  }
  
  const businessScore = calculateBusinessValue(workItem);
  const urgencyScore = calculateUrgency(workItem);
  const combinedScore = businessScore * urgencyScore;
  
  if (combinedScore >= 80) return 'P01';
  if (combinedScore >= 60) return 'P02';
  if (combinedScore >= 40) return 'P03';
  return 'P04';
}
```

### Priority Review AI
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify items that commonly get escalated
- **Dependency Analysis**: Auto-escalate items blocking high priority work
- **Business Value Prediction**: Suggest priority based on historical value delivery
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance priority with team capacity and skills
