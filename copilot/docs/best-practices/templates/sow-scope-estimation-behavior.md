   - Plan for iterative delivery and feedback cycles
   - Include buffer time for uncertainty and risk factors

4. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Provide confidence levels for each estimate (high/medium/low)
   - Identify areas of highest uncertainty
   - Recommend additional discovery or prototyping
   - Suggest phased delivery to reduce risk

5. **Cost Modeling**
   - Calculate resource costs by role and timeline
   - Include infrastructure and tool costs
   - Factor in overhead and project management costs
   - Provide cost breakdown by phase and deliverable

Provide estimates in multiple formats: optimistic, realistic, pessimistic scenarios.
```

### 3. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

```markdown
# Comprehensive Risk Assessment Prompt

For the project scope and estimates:
[Insert scope and estimation details]

Analyze project risks across all dimensions:

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Technology complexity and maturity
   - Integration challenges and dependencies
   - Performance and scalability concerns
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Architecture and design risks

2. **Business Risks**
   - Market conditions and competitive factors
   - Regulatory changes and compliance issues
   - Client organizational changes
   - Budget and funding stability
   - Business value realization risks

3. **Execution Risks**
   - Team capability and availability
   - Timeline and scheduling conflicts
   - Resource allocation and competition
   - Communication and coordination challenges

For each identified risk, provide:
- Probability assessment (High/Medium/Low)
- Impact assessment (High/Medium/Low)
- Risk score (Probability Ã— Impact)
- Mitigation strategies and preventive measures
- Contingency plans for risk materialization
- Early warning indicators and monitoring approaches
