# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a structured approach to transitioning from traditional or legacy AI collaboration methods (like agent crews) to modern AI-assisted SDLC and SOW management practices.

## Assessment Phase (Weeks 1-2)

### Current State Analysis

#### 1. Legacy System Audit
- **Agent Crew Analysis**: Review existing agent definitions and roles
- **Process Documentation**: Catalog current SDLC and SOW processes
- **Tool Inventory**: List current development and project management tools
- **Team Skills Assessment**: Evaluate team's AI interaction experience

#### 2. Knowledge Extraction
```markdown
# Legacy Knowledge Mining Prompt
Review our existing agent crew structure:
[Insert current agent definitions]

Extract:
1. Valuable domain knowledge embedded in agent roles
2. Effective processes and workflows
3. Successful prompt patterns and templates
4. Integration points with existing tools
5. Knowledge gaps that need addressing

Recommend how to preserve valuable elements while modernizing the approach.
