# AI-Assisted SDLC & SOW Best Practices

## Overview

This documentation provides modern best practices for leveraging AI in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Scope of Work (SOW) management. These practices have evolved significantly from the earlier "agent crew" approach to more direct, context-aware AI collaboration.

## Evolution from Agent Crews

The traditional "agent crew" approach involved simulating multiple specialized AI agents with defined roles. While innovative, modern AI interaction has proven more effective with:

- **Direct Context-Rich Interaction**: Single AI sessions with comprehensive context
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Leveraging human judgment with AI assistance
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops
- **Tool Integration**: Using AI with existing development tools and workflows

### Implementation Guides
- [implementation-roadmap.md](./implementation-roadmap.md) - Adopting these practices
- [team-training.md](./team-training.md) - Training developers on AI collaboration
- [governance-framework.md](./governance-framework.md) - Establishing AI usage guidelines

## Key Principles

1. **Context is King**: Provide comprehensive context to AI for better outcomes
2. **Human Oversight**: AI assists, humans decide and validate
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine prompts and processes
4. **Tool Integration**: Embed AI into existing workflows, don't replace them
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Maintain clear, searchable knowledge bases
6. **Measurable Outcomes**: Track the effectiveness of AI assistance

## Getting Started

1. Review the [implementation-roadmap.md](./implementation-roadmap.md)
2. Start with [01-ai-assisted-planning.md](./01-ai-assisted-planning.md)
3. Choose appropriate templates from [templates/](./templates/)
4. Establish team guidelines using [governance-framework.md](./governance-framework.md)

## Migration from Legacy Approach

âœ… **Migration Complete**: The legacy agent crew structure has been successfully converted to modern SOW behaviors:

- **Legacy agents archived** in `../../legacy/crew/` for reference
- **16 agents consolidated** into 4 comprehensive SOW behaviors
- **Knowledge preserved** and enhanced in behavior-based system
- **Integrated workflow** created for efficient SOW development

See `../../legacy/migration-notes.md` for complete migration details.

## Practical Implementation
