## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Knowledge Extraction (Week 1)
1. **Extract Core Knowledge**: Pull valuable information from each agent definition
2. **Identify Overlaps**: Find common knowledge across multiple agents
3. **Create Behavior Maps**: Map agent knowledge to SOW behavior categories
4. **Preserve Expertise**: Ensure no valuable domain knowledge is lost

### Phase 2: Behavior Development (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Create Behavior Templates**: Develop standardized behavior templates
2. **Develop Prompt Libraries**: Convert agent expertise into reusable prompts
3. **Build Context Documents**: Consolidate business and technical context
4. **Create Validation Frameworks**: Establish quality assurance processes

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Week 4)
1. **Pilot Testing**: Test new behaviors on sample SOW projects
2. **Comparison Analysis**: Compare outcomes with agent crew approach
3. **Refinement**: Adjust behaviors based on testing results
4. **Team Training**: Prepare team for new approach adoption

## Benefits of SOW Behavior Approach

### Efficiency Gains
- **Faster Processing**: Direct AI interaction without agent simulation overhead
- **Better Context**: Comprehensive context in single session
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler workflow without agent coordination
- **Improved Integration**: Better integration with existing tools and processes

### Quality Improvements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: All relevant perspectives in single analysis
- **Consistent Output**: Standardized behavior templates ensure consistency
- **Better Validation**: Human oversight built into behavior workflows
- **Continuous Learning**: Feedback loops for ongoing improvement

### Maintainability Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidated knowledge in behavior templates
- **Easier Updates**: Update behaviors rather than multiple agent definitions
- **Version Control**: Track behavior evolution and improvements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Easier to share and replicate successful behaviors

## Migration Checklist

### Knowledge Preservation
- [ ] Extract valuable knowledge from all 16 agent definitions
- [ ] Map agent expertise to SOW behavior categories
- [ ] Create knowledge repository for preserved information
- [ ] Validate that no critical expertise is lost
