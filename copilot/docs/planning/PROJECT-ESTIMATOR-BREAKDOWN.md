## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

This is a **high-impact, high-effort** feature that could transform your lead generation. However, I'd recommend completing some foundation work first:

1. **Start with Google Analytics** (get baseline traffic data)
2. **Optimize contact forms** (improve current conversion rate)
3. **Build portfolio case studies** (credibility for estimator users)
4. **Then build the estimator** (maximum impact with proper foundation)

**Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect, or should we start with one of the quicker wins first?**
