# User Story: P01-PO-00001.01.01 - Image Optimization Implementation

**Work Item ID**: 3005  
**Story Code**: P01-PO-00001.01.01  
**Parent Feature**: 2005 (P01-PO-00001.01 - Image Optimization System)  
**Priority**: Critical (1)  
**State**: Active  
**Effort**: 5 Story Points  
**Created**: 2025-07-24  

## User Story

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want** images to load quickly and efficiently,  
**So that** I can browse the site without delays or data waste.

## Rationale

Image optimization is critical for performance, especially for mobile users and those on slower connections. Fast-loading images improve user experience, reduce bounce rates, and contribute to better search engine rankings through Core Web Vitals improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] WebP format implementation with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
- [ ] Lazy loading for images below the fold
- [ ] Responsive image sizing for different screen densities
- [ ] Compressed images optimized for web delivery
- [ ] Progressive loading for better perceived performance
- [ ] Error handling for failed image loads

### Should Have
- [ ] Next-generation formats (AVIF) support for modern browsers
- [ ] Critical image preloading for above-the-fold content
- [ ] Image CDN integration for global delivery optimization

### Could Have
- [ ] Automatic format detection based on browser capabilities
- [ ] Real-time image optimization and resizing
- [ ] Advanced compression algorithms for specific image types

## Technical Notes

- Use `<picture>` element for format fallbacks
- Implement Intersection Observer API for lazy loading
- Configure `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for responsive images
- Set up automated build pipeline for image optimization
- Monitor Core Web Vitals, especially LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Performance Testing**: Measure page load time improvements
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Verify WebP support and fallbacks work
3. **Mobile Performance**: Test on 3G networks and slower connections
4. **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, CLS, and FID improvements
5. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when images fail to load

## Definition of Done

- All images are optimized for web delivery
- Page load times meet performance targets (LCP < 2.5s)
- Mobile performance scores show significant improvement
- Browser compatibility testing passes across target browsers
- Error handling works gracefully for failed image loads

## Current Status

**Active Development**: Implementation in progress  
**Completed**: Technical research and approach definition  
**In Progress**: WebP format implementation with fallbacks  
**Next Phase**: Lazy loading implementation  
**Target Completion**: Q2 2025  

## Migration Information
