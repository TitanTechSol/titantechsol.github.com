## üí¨ Discussion & Comments

### 2025-07-30 - CAUSAI - Analysis
**Status**: Partially Complete ‚Üí Analysis  
**Comment**: Analyzed current implementation during partially completed story review. Found basic webpack config exists but missing key optimizations: WebP conversion, lazy loading, responsive images, and compression. Current file size reduction is minimal compared to acceptance criteria requirement of 30% reduction and 20% LCP improvement.

### 2025-07-30 - Aiden - Decision
**Status**: Analysis ‚Üí Ready for Implementation  
**Comment**: Confirmed this story needs significant work to meet acceptance criteria. Approved to proceed with implementation. Priority is performance improvement for business value.

### 2025-04-21 - Development Team - Initial Implementation
**Status**: New ‚Üí Partially Complete  
**Comment**: Basic image handling implemented in webpack config with contenthash and 8KB inline threshold. Limited progress made on actual optimization requirements.
