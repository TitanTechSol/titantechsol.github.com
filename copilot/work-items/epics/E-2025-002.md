# Website Performance Optimization

Our website is loading slowly and users are experiencing delays. We need to improve the overall performance to meet our target of under 3 seconds page load time.

## Current Issues:
- Home page takes 6-8 seconds to load
- Images are not optimized
- JavaScript bundles are too large
- No caching strategy implemented
- Database queries are inefficient

## Business Impact:
- User bounce rate has increased by 25%
- Conversion rate has dropped by 15%
- SEO rankings are declining
- Customer complaints about slow site

## Success Criteria:
- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Lighthouse performance score above 90
- Improved Core Web Vitals
- Reduced server response time
- Better user experience metrics

This affects our entire web platform and needs to be addressed across multiple areas including frontend optimization, backend performance, and infrastructure improvements.
