## DETAILED TASKS

### Task 1: Button Variant System (1.5 hours)
**Goal**: Create all button types needed for the website

- [ ] **Primary Buttons**: Main call-to-action styling (used for "Contact Us", "Get Started")
- [ ] **Secondary Buttons**: Alternative actions (used for "Learn More", "View Portfolio")
- [ ] **Tertiary/Text Buttons**: Subtle actions (used for "Cancel", "Back")
- [ ] **Specialty Buttons**: Success, warning, danger variants for specific contexts
- [ ] **Button Sizes**: Small, medium, large, and full-width variations

### Task 2: Interactive States (1 hour)
**Goal**: Implement all button interaction feedback

- [ ] **Default State**: Base button appearance
- [ ] **Hover State**: Visual feedback when mouse hovers over button
- [ ] **Active/Pressed State**: Visual feedback when button is clicked
- [ ] **Focus State**: Accessibility-friendly keyboard navigation styling
- [ ] **Disabled State**: Clear visual indication when button cannot be used
- [ ] **Loading State**: Optional spinner or indication for form submissions

### Task 3: Button Playground Section (1 hour)
**Goal**: Create interactive demonstration and documentation

- [ ] **Interactive Examples**: Live buttons showing all variants and states
- [ ] **State Toggles**: Ability to preview different button states
- [ ] **Copy-Paste Code**: HTML/CSS snippets for each button type
- [ ] **Usage Guidelines**: When to use each button variant
- [ ] **Accessibility Notes**: Best practices for button implementation

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All button variants display correctly across different browsers
- [ ] Interactive states work properly with mouse and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Button sizes scale appropriately on mobile devices
- [ ] Disabled and loading states function as expected

### Design Standards
- [ ] Buttons use standardized colors from the color system
- [ ] Typography follows established text standards
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear between primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons
- [ ] Consistent spacing and alignment with other design elements

### Accessibility Compliance
- [ ] Buttons meet WCAG contrast requirements

## USAGE EXAMPLES

### Button Hierarchy Guidelines
- **Primary Button**: One per page/section, main conversion action

- **Tertiary Button**: Subtle actions, cancellations, back navigation
- **Specialty Buttons**: Contextual actions (delete = danger, save = success)

### Size Guidelines
- **Large**: Hero sections, major call-to-action areas
- **Medium**: Standard forms, content areas, default size
- **Small**: Compact interfaces, inline actions, mobile optimization
- **Full-width**: Mobile forms, modal actions
