# Work Item Discussion & History System

## Overview

This system provides **ADO-style discussion and history tracking** for work items, enabling structured communication and change tracking similar to Azure DevOps work item discussions.

## 🎯 **What This Solves**

### **ADO Features We Now Have:**
- ✅ **Comments/Discussion Thread** for each work item
- ✅ **Change History** with timestamps and authors  
- ✅ **Status Transition Log** (New → In Progress → Complete)
- ✅ **Assignee Changes** tracking
- ✅ **Sprint History** and iteration changes
- ✅ **Testing & Validation** tracking
- ✅ **Related Work Items** linking

### **Integration with CAUSAI:**
- ✅ **Automatic discussion creation** when starting work on stories
- ✅ **Status updates** logged automatically
- ✅ **Progress comments** added by CAUSAI during implementation
- ✅ **Human approval tracking** in discussions
