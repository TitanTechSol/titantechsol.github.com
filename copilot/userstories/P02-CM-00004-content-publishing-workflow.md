# Content Publishing Workflow

## Story Identifier: CM-00004-Content-Publishing-Workflow

**As a** content manager,  
**I want to** implement a structured workflow for content creation, review, approval, and publishing,  
**So that** we maintain high-quality content and prevent errors on the live website.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
As content management becomes more collaborative, having a structured workflow ensures quality control. This is prioritized as medium since basic content management functionality is needed first.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a multi-stage workflow for content: Draft, Review, Approved, Published
- Allow content creators to save drafts without affecting the live site
- Implement a review system where designated reviewers can approve or request changes
- Enable scheduled publishing for future content releases
- Add commenting functionality for feedback during the review process
- Create notifications for workflow transitions (e.g., when content needs review)
- Allow for emergency publishing override by administrators
- Implement content versioning to track changes and enable rollbacks
- Provide preview functionality to see how changes will look on the live site

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration
- P02-CM-00003-user-roles-permissions

## Notes:
- Consider the team size and complexity when implementing workflow
- Start with a simpler workflow that can be expanded as needed
- Focus on making the review process efficient and clear
- Ensure content staging/preview accurately reflects how content will appear on the live site
