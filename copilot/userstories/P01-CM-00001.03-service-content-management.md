# Service Offering Content Management

## Story Identifier: CM-00001.03-Service-Content-Management

**As a** service manager,  
**I want to** update service descriptions, benefits, processes, and technologies,  
**So that** our website accurately reflects our current service offerings and capabilities.

## Priority: High (P01)
Service descriptions are central to communicating our value proposition. They need to evolve as our offerings mature and market needs change.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a structured content model for service offerings in the CMS
- Implement fields for service name, icon reference, description, benefits, process steps, and technologies
- Allow rich text formatting for service descriptions and benefit explanations
- Enable reordering of services to control display priority
- Update the services component to pull data from the CMS instead of hardcoded content
- Maintain the existing interactive service explorer functionality with the new CMS-driven data
- Provide a preview function to view changes before publishing

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration (parent story)

## Notes:
- The current services section uses an interactive explorer with tabs/navigation
- Service icons should remain consistent with the current visual language
- Consider how to handle potential new services that might require UI changes
- Maintain the existing animation and transition effects
