# Build Process Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00008-Build-Process-Optimization

**As a** developer,  
**I want to** enhance the webpack build configuration and process,  
**So that** it produces optimized assets for production deployment and improves developer experience.

## Priority: Low (P03)
This is lower priority as it primarily affects development workflow and build optimization rather than direct user-facing performance.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Optimize webpack configuration for production builds
- Implement asset compression (Brotli/Gzip) in the build process
- Configure modern and legacy bundles for differential serving
- Implement source map optimization for production builds
- Set up bundle analysis and reporting in the build pipeline
- Create development-specific optimizations for faster builds
- Document the build process and configuration options
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline correctly handles optimized builds
- Set up automated performance checks in the build process
- Create a developer guide for performance best practices

## Dependencies:
- P02-PO-00002-bundle-optimization

## Notes:
- Consider tools like speed-measure-webpack-plugin or webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Evaluate if switching to a more modern build tool would be beneficial
- Document any browser compatibility considerations related to build optimizations
- Ensure GitHub Pages deployment process works correctly with optimized builds
- Consider implementing partial builds for faster development cycles
