# Portfolio and Case Study Management

## Story Identifier: CM-00001.02-Portfolio-Management

**As a** marketing manager,  
**I want to** add, edit, and remove portfolio projects and case studies through a user-friendly interface,  
**So that** we can showcase our latest work and success stories without developer assistance.
