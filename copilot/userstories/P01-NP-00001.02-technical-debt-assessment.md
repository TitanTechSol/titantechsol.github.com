# Technical Debt Assessment and Management Plan

## Story Identifier: NP-00001.02-Technical-Debt-Assessment

**As a** development team member,  
**I want to** systematically identify and classify existing technical debt in the website,  
**So that** we can proactively address issues before they impact site performance or impede future development.

## Priority: High (P01)
High priority because unaddressed technical debt compounds over time, making future enhancements increasingly costly and difficult. Addressing this now will create a more sustainable foundation for growth.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Conduct a comprehensive code audit of the current website implementation
- Document architectural patterns and potential improvement areas
- Create a technical debt inventory categorized by type (code, architecture, testing, documentation)
- Prioritize technical debt items based on impact vs. effort matrix
- Identify quick wins that can be addressed in near-term sprints
- Develop refactoring recommendations for critical technical debt items
- Establish coding standards and best practices to prevent new technical debt
- Create a phased technical debt reduction plan integrated with the overall roadmap
- Define metrics to track technical debt over time

## Dependencies:
- P01-NP-00001-strategic-roadmap (parent story)

## Notes:
- Focus on areas that would provide the greatest long-term benefit for future feature development
- Consider creating a "tech debt budget" for each sprint to ensure continuous improvement
- Evaluate current build and deployment processes for potential optimizations
- Document any security or accessibility issues as high-priority technical debt
- Review third-party dependencies and evaluate alternatives where appropriate
