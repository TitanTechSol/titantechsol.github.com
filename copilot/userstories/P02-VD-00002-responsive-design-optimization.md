# Responsive Design Optimization

## Story Identifier: VD-00002-Responsive-Design-Optimization

**As a** website visitor using various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile),  
**I want to** have an optimal viewing and interaction experience regardless of my screen size,  
**So that** I can easily navigate and engage with TitanTech's content on any device.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
While the site already has responsive elements, optimizing the responsive design is critical as mobile usage continues to increase. This is medium priority because the current implementation is functional but could be enhanced.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Audit current responsive behavior and identify pain points across devices
- Establish consistent breakpoints for small mobile, large mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Optimize navigation for mobile devices with improved touch targets (minimum 44px Ã— 44px)
- Ensure all interactive elements are easily accessible on touch devices
- Adapt content layout for different screen sizes rather than simply scaling it down
- Optimize image loading and sizing for different viewport widths
- Ensure forms and input fields are usable on mobile devices
- Verify that all animations and transitions work appropriately across devices
- Test and fix any overflow issues on smaller screens
- Implement container queries for more complex responsive components where appropriate

## Dependencies:

## Notes:
- Current mobile implementation has some areas where text becomes too small or elements crowd on smaller screens
- Focus on a mobile-first approach for new responsive implementations
- Consider the hierarchy of information on mobile vs. desktop
- Pay special attention to navigation and forms on mobile devices
- Use device testing or emulation to verify behavior across various screen sizes
