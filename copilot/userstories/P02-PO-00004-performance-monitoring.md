# Ongoing Performance Monitoring

## Story Identifier: PO-00004-Performance-Monitoring

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** implement ongoing performance monitoring and reporting,  
**So that** we can track performance over time, identify regressions, and continue improving the user experience.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
While not directly improving performance immediately, monitoring ensures optimizations are maintained and helps identify future improvement opportunities.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement Real User Monitoring (RUM) to collect actual user performance data
- Set up automated Lighthouse testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Create a performance dashboard showing key metrics over time
- Configure alerts for performance regressions
- Set up regular performance reporting (weekly or monthly)
- Track Core Web Vitals and custom performance metrics
- Document performance data collection and privacy considerations
- Ensure GDPR compliance for any collected user data
- Create a process for acting on performance insights

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001-performance-audit-strategy

## Notes:
- Consider tools like Google Analytics 4, Web Vitals library, or Lighthouse CI
- Ensure any tracking respects user privacy and provides opt-out options
- The monitoring should have minimal performance impact itself
- Consider collecting both synthetic testing data and real user metrics
- Set up tracking for different device categories and connection types
