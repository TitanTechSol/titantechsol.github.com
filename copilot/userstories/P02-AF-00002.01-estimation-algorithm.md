# Project Estimation Algorithm Development

## Story Identifier: AF-00002.01-Estimation-Algorithm

**As a** website developer,  
**I want to** develop an accurate algorithm for project estimation,  
**So that** potential clients receive realistic and helpful estimates based on their project parameters.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
This is a critical component of the project estimator tool but inherits the medium priority of its parent story.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define base estimation models for different project types (web apps, mobile apps, etc.)
- Create weighted factors for complexity, feature sets, and technology requirements
- Implement calculations for both timeline and cost range estimates
- Account for team composition with junior-senior pairings in the estimation model
- Create an uncertainty factor that widens estimate ranges for projects with unclear requirements
- Build validation rules to prevent unrealistic combinations of parameters
- Develop adaptive logic that adjusts estimates based on interdependent selections
- Include minimum viable product (MVP) estimation options
- Build in flexibility for future adjustment of estimation parameters
- Document the complete estimation algorithm for future maintenance

## Dependencies:
- P02-AF-00002-project-estimator (parent story)

## Notes:
- Collaborate with senior technical team members to validate estimation logic
- Base initial estimates on historical project data when available
- Include guidance notes explaining the reasoning behind estimates
- Estimation should account for both development and testing phases
- Consider how to factor in client involvement/resources in the estimation
