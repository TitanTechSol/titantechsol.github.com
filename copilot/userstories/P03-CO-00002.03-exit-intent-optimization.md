# Exit Intent Optimization

## Story Identifier: CO-00002.03-Exit-Intent-Optimization

**As a** marketing team member,  
**I want to** implement strategic exit-intent interventions to re-engage leaving visitors,  
**So that** we can capture more leads and reduce bounce rates from key pages.

## Priority: Low (P03)
While exit intent features can improve conversion rates, they should be implemented after core conversion elements are optimized, hence the lower priority.

## Story Points: 2

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement exit-intent detection technology that identifies when users are about to leave the site
- Create targeted exit-intent offers based on the page content the user was viewing
- Design visually appealing exit overlays that don't feel intrusive or manipulative
- Develop at least three different exit-intent interventions to test (e.g., lead magnet offer, case study highlight, consultation offer)
- Implement frequency capping to avoid showing exit popups too often to returning visitors
- Set up A/B testing for different exit-intent messages and offers
- Create mobile-specific exit intent strategies that don't rely on cursor movement
- Implement analytics to measure the effectiveness of exit-intent interventions
- Ensure all exit overlays have obvious and easy close options

## Dependencies:
- P02-CO-00002-conversion-analytics (parent story)
- P01-CO-00001.04-lead-magnet-implementation

## Notes:
- Exit intent should feel helpful, not desperate or manipulative
- Consider offering something of immediate value rather than just asking for contact information
- Special attention should be paid to exit intent on high-traffic landing pages and service pages
- Consider different exit offers for different visitor segments or behavior patterns
- Test exit intent timing carefully to avoid interrupting active reading
