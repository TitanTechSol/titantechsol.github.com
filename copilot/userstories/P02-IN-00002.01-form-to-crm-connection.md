# Contact Form to CRM Connection

## Story Identifier: IN-00002.01-Form-CRM-Connection

**As a** sales team member,  
**I want to** have website contact form submissions automatically create records in our CRM,  
**So that** I can immediately begin nurturing new leads without manual data entry or delays.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
This is the core functionality of the CRM integration and inherits the parent story's priority.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement API connection between all website contact forms and the CRM system
- Ensure proper field mapping between form fields and CRM record fields
- Set up real-time lead creation when forms are submitted
- Configure lead source attribution that identifies specific form/page origin
- Implement UTM parameter capture to track marketing campaign effectiveness
- Create duplicate detection to prevent creating multiple records for the same contact
- Set up error handling and notification system for failed submissions
- Implement form validation to ensure quality data is sent to the CRM
- Document the technical implementation and data flow for future reference
- Create test cases covering various submission scenarios

## Dependencies:
- P02-IN-00002-crm-integration (parent story)

## Notes:
- Consider using Zapier or similar tools for easier integration if direct API integration is complex
- Ensure data privacy notices on forms align with how data will be used in the CRM
- Consider progressive form fields that only ask for essential information initially
- Field mapping should account for any custom fields needed in the CRM
- Implement secure data transmission practices for sensitive information
