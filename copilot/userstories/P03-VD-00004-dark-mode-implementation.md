# Dark Mode Implementation

## Story Identifier: VD-00004-Dark-Mode-Implementation

**As a** website visitor who prefers dark interfaces,  
**I want to** be able to view the TitanTech website in a dark color scheme,  
**So that** I can reduce eye strain and battery consumption while browsing, especially in low-light environments.

## Priority: Low (P03)
While dark mode is increasingly popular and beneficial for many users, it's considered lower priority than establishing core design consistency and responsiveness.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement a toggle to switch between light and dark themes
- Create a dark color palette that maintains brand identity while reducing brightness
- Ensure all content maintains sufficient contrast ratios in dark mode (WCAG AA compliance)
- Respect user's system preference for light/dark mode when possible
- Ensure all UI components and graphics are optimized for both modes
- Avoid pure white text on pure black backgrounds to reduce halation effects
- Store user's theme preference and apply on return visits
- Ensure smooth transition when switching between themes
- Test dark mode across all pages and components
- Verify dark mode works properly across all supported browsers and devices

## Dependencies:
- P01-VD-00001-design-system-enhancement
- P01-VD-00001.01-color-scheme-refinement
- P01-VD-00001.03-ui-component-standardization

## Notes:
- Implementation should use CSS custom properties for easy theme switching
- Consider using `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect system preferences
- Dark mode should still maintain the professional, tech-focused feel of the brand
- Ensure images and graphics remain visible and effective in dark mode
- Consider different shadow strategies for dark mode (lighter shadows instead of darker)
