# Conversational Chatbot Implementation

## Story Identifier: CO-00003-Chatbot-Implementation

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** engage with an interactive chatbot to get immediate answers to my questions,  
**So that** I can quickly determine if TitanTech Solutions meets my needs without filling out a form or making a call.

## Priority: Low (P03)
A chatbot can improve engagement and conversion but requires significant setup and maintenance. This is lower priority as other conversion elements should be optimized first.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement a conversational chatbot with natural language processing capabilities
- Create a comprehensive knowledge base to answer common questions about services and processes
- Design chatbot conversation flows that guide users toward conversion actions
- Implement chatbot personality that reflects the TitanTech brand voice
- Create appropriate fallback responses and human handoff options when the chatbot can't help
- Implement context awareness so the chatbot can reference the page the user is viewing
- Design a visually consistent chatbot interface that complements the website design
- Set up chatbot analytics to track common questions and conversation outcomes
- Implement lead capture functionality within chat conversations
- Create scheduling capability for consultation calls directly through the chatbot

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Chatbot should demonstrate technical expertise while remaining approachable
- Consider implementing the junior/senior mentor model in the chatbot personality
- Focus on qualifying leads through conversation rather than just answering questions
- Ensure chatbot doesn't interfere with mobile usability
- Consider operating hours when the chatbot might need to change its responses
