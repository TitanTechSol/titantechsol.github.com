# Landing Page Visual Redesign

## Story Identifier: VD-00007-Landing-Page-Redesign

**As a** first-time visitor to the TitanTech website,  
**I want to** quickly understand what TitanTech offers through an engaging, visually clear landing page,  
**So that** I can decide whether to explore further or contact the company about my software needs.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
The landing page is critical for first impressions and conversion, but this redesign depends on establishing the design system first, hence the medium priority.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a visually impactful hero section that clearly communicates TitanTech's value proposition
- Implement a clean, scannable layout highlighting key service offerings
- Design clear visual pathways to guide users to high-priority conversion points
- Create visual elements that effectively communicate the junior-senior pairing model
- Optimize visual hierarchy to prioritize the most important information
- Develop engaging visualizations of the development process
- Implement subtle animation and interaction to increase engagement
- Ensure the design is fully responsive and maintains visual impact across device sizes
- Create visual testimonial displays that build credibility
- Include visual cues that direct users toward next steps (CTAs)
