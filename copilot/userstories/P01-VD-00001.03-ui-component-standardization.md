# UI Component Standardization

## Story Identifier: VD-00001.03-UI-Component-Standardization

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** interact with consistent UI components throughout my journey on the website,  
**So that** I can easily understand how to navigate and engage with the content without cognitive friction.

## Priority: High (P01)
Standardized UI components create a cohesive experience, reduce cognitive load for users, and reinforce brand identity, directly impacting user satisfaction and conversion rates.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a component library with standardized styles for:
  - Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary styles with states)
  - Cards and containers
  - Form elements (inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons)
  - Navigation elements
  - Alerts and notifications
  - Modal dialogs
  - Tabs and accordions
- Define consistent spacing, padding, and margin values
- Document hover, active, focus, and disabled states for interactive elements
- Ensure all components meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Implement consistent shadow styles and elevation system
- Create reusable CSS classes or components for development efficiency
- Ensure all components work properly across responsive breakpoints

## Dependencies:
- P01-VD-00001-design-system-enhancement (parent story)
- P01-VD-00001.01-color-scheme-refinement

## Notes:
- Currently, the site has some inconsistencies in how cards, buttons, and other UI elements are styled
- Focus on creating components that can be easily implemented by the development team
- Ensure components have appropriate visual feedback for user interactions
- Consider implementing a design token system for consistent properties like border-radius, shadows, etc.
