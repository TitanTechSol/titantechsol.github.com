# Media Asset Library Management

## Story Identifier: CM-00002-Media-Library-Management

**As a** content creator,  
**I want to** have a centralized library for managing images, documents, and other media assets,  
**So that** I can efficiently reuse media across the website and maintain consistency.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
While content editability is the primary concern, having a structured way to manage media assets becomes important once content updates begin. This is prioritized as medium since it supports but is not critical to initial content management capabilities.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement a centralized media library within the CMS
- Enable image uploads with automatic optimization for web
- Support common image formats (JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP)
- Allow document uploads for case studies and downloadable resources (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Provide search functionality within the media library
- Allow categorization and tagging of media assets
- Implement metadata management for alt text and captions
- Create a media browser for selecting assets when editing content
- Ensure media library integrates with all content types (team profiles, services, portfolio)

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration

## Notes:
