## Notes:
- Start with simple rule-based recommendations before implementing more complex algorithms
- Focus on recommending content that drives users toward conversion points
- Consider recency and frequency when weighting user behaviors
- Ensure the system can function with limited data for first-time visitors
- Recommendations should prominently feature content that highlights the junior-senior pairing model advantages
