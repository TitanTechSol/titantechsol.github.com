# Persona-Based User Journeys Implementation

## Story Identifier: NP-00002.02-Persona-Journeys

**As a** website visitor with specific role and needs,  
**I want to** follow a customized website journey based on my professional profile,  
**So that** I can efficiently access information most relevant to my specific challenges and decision-making criteria.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
This inherits the medium priority of its parent story as it's a specific implementation aspect of the broader personalization strategy.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define 3-5 key user personas based on roles (e.g., CTO, Project Manager, Developer)
- Create specialized content journeys for each persona with relevant pathways
- Implement a persona selection mechanism for visitors to self-identify
- Develop a persistent preference system to remember user choices
- Customize navigation highlights based on selected persona
- Adapt content emphasis and terminology based on persona (technical vs. business-focused)
- Create persona-specific CTAs throughout the site
- Build dashboard to track engagement patterns by persona
- Design elegant experience for users who don't select a persona

## Dependencies:
- P02-NP-00002-advanced-personalization (parent story)

## Notes:
- Focus on subtle personalization that enhances rather than restricts the user experience
- Ensure visitors can easily change or remove their selected persona
- Consider combining explicit persona selection with inferred behavior for hybrid personalization
- Test thoroughly to ensure personalization doesn't create confusion or hide important content
- Ensure content emphasizes different aspects of the junior-senior model based on persona (e.g., cost efficiency for business roles, knowledge transfer for technical roles)
