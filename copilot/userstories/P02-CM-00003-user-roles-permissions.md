# User Roles and Permissions System

## Story Identifier: CM-00003-User-Roles-Permissions

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** define roles and permissions for different content contributors,  
**So that** team members can update content relevant to their roles while maintaining overall content quality and security.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
Once basic content management is established, controlling who can edit what becomes important for quality and security. This is a medium priority as it's needed before widespread content contributor access.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Define at least three user roles: Administrator, Editor, and Contributor
- Allow administrators to create and manage user accounts
- Implement granular permissions for different content types (team, services, portfolio, etc.)
- Create section-specific permissions (e.g., someone who can only edit testimonials)
- Enable user role assignment and management
- Implement approval workflows based on user roles
- Provide audit logging of content changes with user attribution
- Allow temporary access permissions for contract contributors

## Dependencies:
- P01-CM-00001-cms-integration

## Notes:
- Ensure security best practices for user authentication
- Consider single sign-on options if applicable
- Define clear permission boundaries to prevent accidental content changes
- Document the roles and responsibilities for training purposes
