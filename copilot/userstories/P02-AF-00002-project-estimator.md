# Interactive Project Estimation Tool

## Story Identifier: AF-00002-Project-Estimator

**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** use an interactive tool to estimate the scope and cost of my software project,  
**So that** I can get a preliminary understanding of the investment required before contacting TitanTech Solutions.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
This feature provides value to potential clients in their decision-making process but isn't as critical as establishing thought leadership through the blog platform.

## Story Points: 8

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Create a multi-step interactive estimation form
- Include project type selection with different templates for common project types
- Implement dynamic questions that change based on previous answers
- Allow users to select desired features from predefined categories
- Include timeline estimation based on selected features and scope
- Provide ballpark cost ranges rather than specific figures
- Generate a downloadable PDF summary of the estimate
- Capture user contact information for follow-up (with explicit consent)
- Send estimates to user's email with option to schedule a consultation
- Track usage analytics to improve the tool over time

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- Tool should emphasize value rather than just cost
- Estimations should highlight the benefit of the junior-senior pairing model
- Make it clear that estimates are preliminary and subject to more detailed analysis
- Include educational elements that help users understand factors impacting software project costs
- Consider implementing a complexity score in addition to time/cost estimates
