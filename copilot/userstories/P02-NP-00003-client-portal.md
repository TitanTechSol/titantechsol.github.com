# Secure Client Portal Implementation

## Story Identifier: NP-00003-Client-Portal

**As a** TitanTech client,  
**I want to** access a secure portal to view my project status, documents, and communications,  
**So that** I can easily track progress and collaborate with the TitanTech team in a centralized location.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
A client portal would significantly enhance client experience and operational efficiency, but requires the core website and key services to be well-established first.

## Story Points: 8

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Design a secure authentication system with role-based access controls
- Create a dashboard with project status visualizations and metrics
- Implement document storage and sharing with version control
- Build a messaging/communication system for project-related discussions
- Develop calendar integration for milestone tracking and meeting scheduling
- Create notification system for updates and required actions
- Implement secure payment processing for invoices (if applicable)
- Establish user management for client team members with different permission levels
- Design mobile-responsive interface for access across devices
- Create comprehensive security protocols for sensitive project data

## Dependencies:
- Core website implementation must be complete
- User authentication system implementation

## Notes:
- Portal should emphasize transparency in development process, including clear visibility into the junior-senior pairing model in action
- Consider using Progressive Web App (PWA) technologies for improved mobile experience
- Portal should integrate with existing project management tools used internally
- Focus on intuitive UX to minimize client training requirements
- Consider phased implementation, starting with core functionality and adding features over time
