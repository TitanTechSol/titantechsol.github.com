# JavaScript Bundle Optimization

## Story Identifier: PO-00002-Bundle-Optimization

**As a** website administrator,  
**I want to** optimize JavaScript bundles beyond code splitting,  
**So that** all users receive the smallest possible payload, improving load times and performance.

## Priority: Medium (P02)
While code splitting addresses initial load performance, further bundle optimizations will improve performance across all user interactions with reduced JavaScript payload.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement tree shaking to eliminate unused JavaScript
- Replace large dependencies with smaller alternatives where possible
- Configure webpack for production optimizations (scope hoisting, minification, etc.)
- Implement module/nomodule pattern for modern browsers
- Reduce total JavaScript payload by at least 20%
- Document dependencies that could be replaced in the future
- Ensure no regression in functionality across browsers
- Validate improvements with performance testing
- Create a bundle size budget and automated checks in the build pipeline

## Dependencies:
- P01-PO-00001.02-code-splitting-lazy-loading

## Notes:
- Consider using Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify optimization targets
- Look specifically at third-party libraries that can be removed or replaced
- Investigate polyfill optimization strategies
- Consider implementing differential serving based on browser capabilities
- Document any browser compatibility considerations for the development team
