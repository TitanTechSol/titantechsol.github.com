# Contact Form Optimization

## Story Identifier: CO-00001.02-Contact-Form-Optimization

**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** easily submit my project inquiry through an intuitive, friction-reduced contact form,  
**So that** I can quickly engage with TitanTech Solutions about my software development needs.

## Priority: High (P01)
The contact form is the primary conversion point for turning visitors into leads. Any friction in this process directly impacts lead generation effectiveness.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Redesign the contact form with a multi-step process to reduce perceived complexity
- Implement conditional fields that appear only when relevant to the user's specific needs
- Add progress indicators for multi-step forms to increase completion rates
- Create context-sensitive help text that anticipates and addresses user questions
- Implement inline validation with helpful error messages to reduce form abandonment
- Add smart defaults and auto-fill where appropriate to reduce user effort
- Create a compelling "thank you" page with clear next steps after form submission
- Optimize form for mobile submission with appropriate input types and keyboard layouts
- Implement form analytics to identify abandonment points and opportunities for improvement

## Dependencies:
- P01-CO-00001-conversion-strategy (parent story)

## Notes:
- Consider what information is truly necessary vs. nice-to-have at initial contact
- Balance detail collection with user experience â€“ don't ask for too much information upfront
- Ensure the form effectively qualifies leads while not creating unnecessary barriers
- Test form completion time to ensure it stays under 2-3 minutes
- Consider implementing a "save and continue later" function for complex project inquiries
