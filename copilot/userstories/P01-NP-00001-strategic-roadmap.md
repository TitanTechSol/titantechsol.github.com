# Strategic Website Roadmap Development

## Story Identifier: NP-00001-Strategic-Roadmap

**As a** business stakeholder,  
**I want to** develop a comprehensive, phased website evolution strategy based on business goals and user feedback,  
**So that** future website enhancements align with company growth objectives and deliver measurable ROI.

## Priority: High (P01)
Creating a strategic roadmap is essential for guiding all future website developments. Without this foundation, we risk making disconnected improvements that don't cohesively support business goals or create maximum impact for users.

## Story Points: 5

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Conduct a comprehensive analysis of current website performance metrics and user behavior
- Perform stakeholder interviews to identify key business objectives for the next 12-18 months
- Develop user personas and journey maps to identify pain points and opportunities
- Create a prioritized enhancement roadmap with 3-6-9-12 month milestones
- Define success metrics and KPIs for each roadmap phase
- Include resource requirements and estimates for each phase
- Document technical dependencies and prerequisites between phases
- Establish a governance process for roadmap updates and adjustments
- Create a visual roadmap presentation for executive stakeholders

## Dependencies:
- None (this is a parent story)

## Notes:
- The roadmap should specifically address how future enhancements will showcase the junior-senior developer pairing model
- Consider creating separate tracks for marketing-focused vs. technical showcase enhancements
- Ensure the roadmap includes regular evaluation points to incorporate new user feedback
- The roadmap should balance quick wins with longer-term strategic improvements
- Include consideration for emerging technologies and industry trends
