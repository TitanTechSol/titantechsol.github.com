# AI-Powered Website Enhancement

## Story Identifier: NP-00006-AI-Integration

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** interact with intelligent, AI-powered features that enhance my experience,  
**So that** I can more efficiently find information, evaluate services, and engage with TitanTech Solutions.

## Priority: Low (P03)
AI enhancements provide cutting-edge user experience but are not critical to core website functionality, hence the lower priority designation.

## Story Points: 8

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Implement an AI-powered conversational assistant for website navigation and questions
- Create a system to provide personalized content recommendations based on user interactions
- Develop intelligent form features that adapt based on user inputs
- Build predictive search functionality with smart auto-complete
- Implement natural language processing for improved site search capabilities
- Create automated lead qualification scoring based on visitor behavior and inputs
- Ensure all AI features maintain user privacy and data security
- Provide transparent opt-in/opt-out options for AI-powered features
- Create an analytics dashboard to track AI feature effectiveness
- Document a process for ongoing AI model training and improvement

## Dependencies:
- Analytics implementation must be in place
- User behavior data collection framework

## Notes:
- Focus on AI implementations that provide tangible user value rather than novelty
- Consider using existing AI services/APIs rather than building from scratch
- Ensure AI features align with TitanTech's brand position as a technology expert
- The conversation assistant should be particularly knowledgeable about the junior-senior pairing model
- Create fallback mechanisms for when AI cannot address user needs
