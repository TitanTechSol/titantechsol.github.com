# Calendar Scheduling Integration

## Story Identifier: IN-00004-Calendar-Scheduling

**As a** potential client,  
**I want to** schedule a consultation or discovery call directly from the website,  
**So that** I can easily book time with TitanTech Solutions without back-and-forth emails about availability.

## Priority: Low (P04)
While valuable for streamlining the consultation booking process, this has lower priority than analytics, CRM, and email marketing integrations which form the core of our lead generation infrastructure.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Select an appropriate scheduling tool (e.g., Calendly, HubSpot Meetings, Acuity)
- Implement calendar integration with team members' availability
- Create different meeting types (e.g., discovery call, technical consultation, project review)
- Set up customized booking forms with relevant questions for each meeting type
- Ensure scheduled meetings are automatically added to team calendars
- Implement buffer time between meetings to avoid back-to-back scheduling
- Create automated email confirmations and reminders for scheduled meetings
- Set up integration between scheduling tool and CRM system
- Implement analytics tracking for booking conversions
- Ensure the scheduling interface is fully responsive on all devices
- Add appropriate styling to match the website's visual design

## Dependencies:
- P02-IN-00002-crm-integration (for lead data synchronization)

## Notes:
- Consider the balance between gathering information and friction in the booking process
- Ensure the tool supports rescheduling and cancellation options
- Consider implementing timezone detection for international clients
- Evaluate the need for team round-robin scheduling vs. specific team member selection
- Ensure the scheduling process reflects the professionalism of the TitanTech brand
