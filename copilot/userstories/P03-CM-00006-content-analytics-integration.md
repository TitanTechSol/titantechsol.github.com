# Content Analytics Integration

## Story Identifier: CM-00006-Content-Analytics-Integration

**As a** marketing manager,  
**I want to** see analytics data associated with specific content pieces within the CMS,  
**So that** I can measure content effectiveness and make data-driven decisions about future updates.

## Priority: Low (P03)
Analytics integration enhances the value of the CMS but is not essential to its core functionality. This is appropriately prioritized as a later enhancement.

## Story Points: 3
