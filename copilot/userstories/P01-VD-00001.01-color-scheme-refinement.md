# Color Scheme Refinement

## Story Identifier: VD-00001.01-Color-Scheme-Refinement

**As a** website visitor,  
**I want to** experience a visually consistent and emotionally appropriate color scheme throughout the website,  
**So that** I can easily navigate content while subconsciously developing trust in TitanTech's brand and professionalism.

## Priority: High (P01)
High priority as color is one of the most immediately noticeable aspects of brand identity and directly impacts user perception of the company's professionalism and attention to detail.

## Story Points: 3

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Refine the existing blue-focused color palette to create better visual hierarchy and emphasis
- Incorporate color contrast ratios that meet WCAG AA accessibility standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Define primary action colors that draw attention to key conversion points
- Establish secondary and tertiary colors for supporting elements
- Create neutral color scales for text, backgrounds, and UI elements
- Document color variables in CSS with semantic naming conventions
- Implement the refined color scheme across all pages
- Test color scheme in both light and dark environments
- Include color variations for hover, active, and focus states

## Dependencies:
- P01-VD-00001-design-system-enhancement (parent story)

## Notes:
- The current color scheme uses mostly blue variations (#064BA5, #0764de) which could be expanded to include complementary colors
- Consider adding accent colors to highlight important actions or information
- Ensure colors reflect the company's values of technical excellence, innovation, and quality
- Consider color psychology in the selection (blue for trust and stability, potential accent colors for innovation and energy)
