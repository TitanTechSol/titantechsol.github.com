# GitHub Profile Integration for Team Members - CANCELLED

**Status**: CANCELLED - Business decision made to exclude GitHub integration  
**Date Cancelled**: 2025-01-25  
**Reason**: GitHub profile integration not aligned with current business strategy  

## Problem Statement
~~Team member profiles contain placeholder GitHub links instead of actual profiles, reducing credibility and missing opportunities to showcase technical expertise.~~ **CANCELLED PER BUSINESS DECISION**

## Current Issues
- **Placeholder links**: GitHub links not implemented for most team members
- **Missed opportunity**: Can't showcase open source contributions
- **Incomplete profiles**: Reduces trust and credibility
- **Technical showcase**: Missing chance to display code quality

## Required Updates
1. **Aaron Kibbie**: Update GitHub profile link
2. **Daniel Peckham**: Add GitHub profile link  
3. **Anthony Hart**: Add GitHub profile link
4. **Aiden Kibbie**: Add GitHub profile link
5. **Corinne Kibbie**: Marketing profile (may not need GitHub)

## Implementation Details
```javascript
// Update teamMembers array in team.js
{
  id: 1,
  name: "G. Aaron Kibbie",
  // ... existing fields
  github: "https://github.com/aaronkibbie", // Add actual URL
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-kibbie-b72a401/"
}
```
