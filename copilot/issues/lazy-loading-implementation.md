# Lazy Loading Implementation for Images

## Problem Statement
All website images load immediately on page load, causing unnecessary delays and poor performance, especially on slower connections.

## Current Issues
- **Immediate loading**: All team photos load even if user doesn't scroll to team section
- **Bundle impact**: 600KB+ images block initial page rendering
- **Mobile performance**: Poor experience on slow connections
- **Wasted bandwidth**: Users may not view all content

## Technical Implementation
1. **React lazy loading**: Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to images
2. **Intersection Observer**: More advanced lazy loading for React components
3. **Placeholder strategy**: Show skeleton or blur placeholder while loading
4. **Progressive enhancement**: Ensure fallback for older browsers

## Expected Performance Gains
- **Initial page load**: 50-70% faster
- **Time to Interactive**: Significantly reduced
- **Bandwidth savings**: Only load visible content
- **Core Web Vitals**: Better LCP and FCP scores

## Implementation Approach
```javascript
// Add to team.js and other image components
<img 
  src={member.photo} 
  alt={member.name}
  loading="lazy"
  className="team-photo"
/>
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Images load only when entering viewport
- Smooth loading experience with placeholders
- No layout shift during image loading
- Compatible with all target browsers
- Measurable performance improvement

## Business Impact
- **User retention**: Faster loading = lower bounce rate
- **SEO improvement**: Google ranks faster sites higher
- **Mobile experience**: Critical for mobile-first users
- **Technical credibility**: Shows performance awareness

## Priority
**High** - Quick implementation with significant impact
