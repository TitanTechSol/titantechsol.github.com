# TitanTech Solutions AI-Assisted Development Framework

## Overview

This directory contains TitanTech Solutions' modernized AI development framework managed by **CAUSAI** (Complete Automated User Story AI). CAUSAI automates the creation and completion of user stories for the TitanTech website (TitanTech.g2ad.com) and business processes.

## 🤖 CAUSAI Integration

**CAUSAI** is your automated development agent that:
- Completes user stories from start to finish
- Shows visual and code changes before committing  
- Minimizes human input while maintaining quality control
- Focuses on business process improvements

### Quick Start with CAUSAI
```bash
# See available user stories
./scripts/causai-workflow.sh stories

# Start working on a specific story
./scripts/causai-workflow.sh start P01-CE-00001.01

# Test visual changes
./scripts/causai-workflow.sh dev
```
